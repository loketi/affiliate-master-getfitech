      <h1 id="how-to-exercise-without-expensive-gym-equipment">How
        to exercise without expensive gym
        equipment</h1>
      <p>It can be expensive to stay fit when you
        factor in gym membership and class costs,
        but it doesn’t have to be that way. Here,
        we show you eight ways to maintain fitness
        without gym equipment or trainer fees.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>More and more of us are taking up sports,
        watching hundreds of hours of online
        fitness videos, and signing up to a
        growing number of health initiatives aimed
        at getting us moving, so there’s really
        never been a better time to get fit for
        free. All it takes is a bit of research,
        so lets dig in…</p>
      <h2 id="running">Running</h2>

      <style>

    text-align: center;
}
</style> <p>More of us are running now than ever
        before, thanks, in part, to free running
        groups that have sprung up over the past
        few years. <a href="https://www.parkrun.us/" target="_blank">parkrun</a>
        is one such group which has inspired
        thousands to lace up. Held each Saturday
        morning in outdoor spaces around the
        country, parkrun is a free, chip-timed 5K
        run, open to every ability. A number of
        sports retailers have free running groups
        so be sure to check out what’s available
        in your area.</p>
      <p>If you’re new to running, there are
        plenty of free online training plans to
        get you started such as the free online <a
          href="https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/running/nike-run-club/training-plans" target="_blank">Nike+
          training guides</a> available for
        download on the company’s website. The
        course is designed by world-famous coaches
        like Jerry Schumacher and Chris Bennett
        and the offerings range from an eight-week
        5K plan to an 18-week schedule for
        aspiring marathoners.</p>
      <p>If you feel inspired to stick with it for
        the long haul then the <a href="https://www.baa.org/" target="_blank">Boston
          Athletic Association</a> offers <a href="https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/participant-information/boston-marathon-training-plan.aspx" target="_blank">online
          marathon training plans</a> pegged to
        its most famous race and it’s totally
        free.</p>
      <p>We also have lots of advice on how to eat
        <strong>before</strong>, <strong>during</strong>,
        and <strong>after</strong> your run.</p>
      <h2 id="walking">Walking</h2>
      <p class="aligncenter"> <img src="hiking-outdoors-ski-blue-preview.webp"

      </p>

}
</style> <p>Health professionals recommend that
        we should aim to do 30 minutes of moderate
        exercise at least five times a week.
        Walking counts as moderate exercise, so it
        often takes just a few changes to your
        lifestyle to achieve this target. If
        you’re keen to explore your area on foot,
        there are lots of free walking groups and
        clubs, some run by local councils, others
        by fellow walkers keen to meet like-minded
        people. <a href="https://ava.org/" target="_blank">American
          Volkssport Association (AVA)</a> and <a
          href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank">Meetup</a>
        are good places to start.</p>
      <h2 id="cycling">Cycling</h2>
      <p>The great outdoors is yours for the
        taking when you have two wheels. If you
        don’t own a bike then the government’s <a
          href="https://www.doi.gov/ofas/bicycle-subsidy-benefit-program" target="_blank">Bicycle
          Subsidy Program</a> is a great way to
        acquire one. Ask your employer if they are
        part of the program. If you’re keen to
        commute by bike the <a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/us-bicycle-route-system/" target="_blank">U.S.
          Bicycle Route System (USBRS)</a> is a
        developing national network of bicycle
        routes connecting urban and rural
        communities via signed roads and trails
        complete with maps so definitely worth
        checking out.</p>
      <p>For advice on how to sustain yourself
        while on your bike, read our guides on
        what to eat [before], [during] and [after]
        [cycling].</p>
      <h2 id="outdoor-gyms">Outdoor gyms</h2>
      <p>Fitness trails also known as outdoor
        gyms, trim trails or activity trails,
        feature exercise equipment and can be
        found in parks and recreation areas around
        the country. They are great places to do
        DIY circuits sessions, where you rotate
        around the different pieces of equipment
        and work on your strength and
        co-ordination. The most famous is ofcourse
        Muscle Beach in Venice CA if you happen to
        be in that part of the country. You can
        search for others from <a href="https://calisthenics-parks.com/countries/us-en-united-states" target="_blank"><em>Calisthenics Parks in the USA</em></a></p>
      <h2 id="team-sports-tennis-soccer-rugby--more">Team
        sports: tennis, soccer, rugby &amp; more</h2>
      <p>Doing what you enjoy makes exercise less
        of a chore and means you’re more likely to
        stick with it. Whether it’s a casual
        five-a-side soccer team or a local tennis
        club, there are thousands of amateur
        groups and clubs around the country, and
        many are free to join. Check local
        listings of professional sports bodies
        such as the <strong>NFL</strong>, <strong>Rugby
          Union</strong> or <strong>Tennis</strong>.</p>
      <h2 id="alternative-exercise">Alternative
        exercise</h2>
      <p>Exercise doesn’t have to be about lifting
        weights or running; any activity which
        gets your muscles moving and increases
        your heart rate counts. With this in mind,
        a number of initiatives have popped up in
        recent years which get you exercising
        while doing something else for example
        green Gyms; these are free outdoor
        sessions where you are guided in practical
        activities such as planting trees or
        building wildlife ponds.</p>
      <p>Similarly, GoodGym is a running-based
        initiative where members get fit to do
        good in their community. The tasks are
        many and varied ie you could help to paint
        a community centre one week, or run to
        visit an isolated older person in your
        area the next. GoodGym is popular in the
        UK but efforts are underway to establish
        it state side.</p>
      <h2 id="living-room-gym">Living room-gym</h2>
      <p class="aligncenter"> <img src="pexels-gustavo-fring-414893.webp"
          alt="woman exercising in living room">
      </p>
      <style>
.aligncenter {
    text-align: center;
}
</style> <p>If you can’t make the gym, make the
        gym come to you by turning everyday
        household items into pieces of equipment.
        Soup cans are an old favourite to double
        up as light weights, an old pair of tights
        can turn into a resistance band, a solid
        chair is an ideal place to do triceps dips
        and stairs can be transformed into a
        fitness step. If you’re keen to get hold
        of proper weights, keep an eye on sites
        such as <a href="https://www.freecycle.org/" target="_blank">Freecycle</a>
        where people sometimes give them away for
        free.</p>
      <p>Should you find yourself getting
        distracted by the TV or radio at home, try
        exercising in ad breaks: choose a
        different move for each advert (think
        squats, lunges, press ups, mountain
        climbers, sit ups, etc) and keep going
        until the ad break finishes, repeating in
        subsequent ad breaks. Checkout YouTube as
        well, there are amazing workout channels
        there like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FitnessBlender/featured" target="_blank">FitnessBlender</a>,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVl6ZdslZz2Zj-34bMJFPbg" target="_blank">Leslie
          Sansone’s Walk at Home</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDUlDJcPPOOQK-3UrxEyhAQ" target="_blank">Roberta’s
          Gym</a> and many more with some serious
        ideas for gentle exercise around the home.</p>
      <h2 id="online-resources">Online resources</h2>
      <p>In the days of smart phones and smart
        TVs, there are thousands of easily
        accessible fitness videos, podcasts and
        apps you can follow for free. All sorts of
        activities are available, from pilates and
        yoga to strength and cardio workouts.
        Whatever you choose, make sure the advice
        comes from someone certified by a
        reputable fitness organisation – in the
        USA, look out for trainers accredited by <a
          href="https://www.credentialingexcellence.org/ncca" target="_blank">NCCA</a>.</p>
      <p>If you’re new to exercise or returning to
        it, the NIS has produced a <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/exercise-physical-activity" target="_blank">range
          of online resources</a> which are good
        starting points. The <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/strength-and-flexibility/Pages/strength-flexibility-podcasts.aspx" target="_blank">Strength
          &amp; Flex podcast</a> by the NHS in the
        UK is also a highly recommended resource.
        It’s a free five-week plan consisting of a
        series of equipment-free exercises
        designed to improve your strength and
        flexibility, and its 10-minutes cardio
        workout is an amazing aerobic starter.</p>
